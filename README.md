## Terminus
Terminus is software for a smart mirror that integrates a default, up-to-date dashboard with a terminal-like user interface with voice activation and AI. Developed using the MagicMirror² source code, this project will utilise wake-word detection and LLama2 for AI integration.

## Project Goals

- Integrate voice activation using Picovoice Porcupine, for wake word detection - "Ressurrect".
- inegrate custom module that uses local LLM, likely llama2, for ai-tts integration.
- Build a custom "terminal-style" module for voice io.
- Retain customised, and default functionality of MagicMirror² smart mirror, while creating customised modules.
